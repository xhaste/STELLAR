# STELLAR
 First Web Development Project.
 I want to build a social media mobile app similar to instagram with the main theme being, users sorted into constellations ideally 4. users will have a chat-room with others in the same constellation (these may have to be regional). There will be group things such as daily playlist. this will entail users having one of their listened to songs be put on a playlist amongst others of the same constellation. this would require a connection to Spotify or apple music. The app will have the usual photo-sharing ,following and followers, DMs and calls and users will be able to collect badges from things such as activites and app-wide events with the first badge given to the first [amount] of users. I envision the app to have a gradient Black,Blue,Purple theme and if anyone is interested in creating this i will provide my inspirations via discord message.

 i would like this to be a public project and any help would greatly appreciated 

 many thanks, 
 Nathan
